# Overview

#### This repository contains an automated testing project developed using Java and Selenium for an e-commerce web application currently in its pre-production phase. The project was created as part of a QA internship program for the company Quality Island and was collaboratively built by a team of 10 testing interns.

Each team member was responsible for a specific part of the applicationâ€”typically one major module or a few smaller ones. Within their assigned module(s), testers were tasked with designing and implementing automated regression tests to verify key functionalities. These tests focused on validating the correctness of page titles and URLs, as well as ensuring the visibility and clickability of core UI components.

The goal of the project was to build a reliable suite of automated tests that could help maintain the quality of the application as it moved closer to production.
